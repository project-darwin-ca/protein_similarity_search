## The Outcome: Protein Similarity Search

Similarity search was able to extract the structurally/functionally similar proteins.

| Features  | Input Protein  | Similar Protein 1 from Cortex AI | Similar Protein 2 from Cortex AI |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **ID**    | LICHRVHGLQTCEPDQKFCFRKTTMFFPNHPVLL MGTSSCPTEKYSVCCSTDKCNK | P0DQH2 | P0DKS3 |
| **Name**  | Neurotoxin Oh9-1 | Exactin | Mambalgin-2 |
| **Organism** | King Cobra | Sepedon haemachatus | Black Mamba |
| **Function** | This toxin binds and inhibits rat muscle Toxin activity | Anticoagulant protein that prevents the activation of factor X (F10). It acts by potently inhibiting the extrinsic tenase complex. | This three-finger toxin inhibits ASIC channels. It acts as a gating modifier toxin by decreasing the apparent proton sensitivity of activation and by slightly increasing the apparent proton sensitivity for inactivation. |
